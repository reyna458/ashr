            <h2>The Addams Family</h2>
            <p>Working on the marketing material for <i>The Addams Family Musical</i> was such a fun experience for me. These characters are so charming and iconic, and I loved learning the history of the franchise. I taught myself to draw in the style of the original comic strip and referenced the 90s movies to create the logo. I've highlighted the main poster here which is one of my favorite things I've ever made.</p>

It is a framed picture hung on a wall with fancy but peeling purple wallpaper. The picture in the frame is cartoon representations of the Addams Family (Morticia, Gomez, Pugsley, Wednesday, Fester, Grandma Addams, Thing and Lurch). Show dates are written in a spooky font and wobwebs and blood splatters decorate the edges of the poster."></a>

            <h2>Sweatshirts</h2>
            <p>In my time as marketing manager at Inglemoor, I ended up making three different clothing designs. The Addams Family one is my personal favorite. It's certainly more understated than the others and the black turned out great.</p>

            <p>When time came from the department's production of Clue, I had become a lot more skilled with Photoshop and Illustrator and began designing Instagram posts weeks in advance, desigining them so they both looked good on their own and formed a greater picture when looking at the grid as whole. I can't guarantee it will still be aligned on the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/inglemoortheatreco/?hl=en">official Instagram</a>, so I've put the full image here without the grid lines.</p>

            <h3>Addams Filter</h3>
            <p>As I did for Clue, I made a 'which character are you?' filter to promote our show on Instagram. The cast got a kick out of it, and it was a fun challenge to figure out how to make. This one was a little more advanced than the Clue filter, because I wanted each character portrait to fit within the picture frame. I still use this one sometimes when I'm bored...</p>
